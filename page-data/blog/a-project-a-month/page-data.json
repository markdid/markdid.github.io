A true dilemma; as soon as one idea seems appealing enough to actually work on, another -far superior- idea comes up. I was inspired by Youtuber and ex-NASA engineer Mark Rober, who manages to complete <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHTizZ_XcUM\">major projects each month</a>. I figured if he could do it I could at least try ðŸ˜­. So starting this month, I'll do my best to create prototypes of ideas I have. I have a lot of things lined up, but for October I'm starting with this website to document it all onâ€Š-â€Šbuilt in React with GatsbyJS.</p>\n<p>I'm a full-time computer science student with a part-time job as a web developer so time is certainly limited and I have no shortage of programming projects to work on. Nevertheless, I think it's important to spend at least some time on personal passion projects and maybe I can finish college having actually accomplished something.</p>\n<h3>Other things i'm working on:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning web scraping in python</li>\n<li>C++ Lexer (For college)</li>\n<li>React Native</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Hopefully I can keep this up for as long as I hope.. That's all, thanks for reading!</p>","id":"b40fd441-abbc-53d8-95a5-6bb3cdcd4c7d","frontmatter":{"title":"A Project A Month","date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","description":"I'm documenting my efforts to complete a DIY project every month!
