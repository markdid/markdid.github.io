I always have too many ideas to work on any of them. A true dilemma; as soon as one idea seems appealing enough to actually work on, another -far superior- idea comes up. I was inspired by Youtuber and ex-NASA engineer Mark Rober, who manages to complete [major projects each month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHTizZ_XcUM). I figured if he could do it I could at least try :sob:. So starting this month, I'll do my best to create prototypes of ideas I have. I have a lot of things lined up, but for October I'm starting with this website to document it all on - built in React with GatsbyJS.

I'm a full-time computer science student with a part-time job as a web developer so time is certainly limited and I have no shortage of programming projects to work on. Nevertheless, I think it's important to spend at least some time on personal passion projects and maybe I can finish college having actually accomplished something.

### Other things i'm working on:
 - Learning web scraping in python
 - C++ Lexer (For college)
 - React Native
 
 Hopefully I can keep this up for as long as I hope.. That's all, thanks for reading!
