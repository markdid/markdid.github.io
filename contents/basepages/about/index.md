####Why does this site exist??
I'm wondering the same thing. For one because I wanted to try out gatsby js. Also becuase it's the hip thing to do.

I'm currently a computer science student at BYU. I work as a web developer using mostly React js, Node, Express js and feathers js. I've been programming for about 8 years but only started web development in late 2018. If you want to hire me, send me a message!
